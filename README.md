# LaTeX template for PWr Students

## What it's this?

This is a template for writing a thesis in LaTeX. It is based on the template provided by the [WIT website](https://wit.pwr.edu.pl/studenci/dyplomanci/praca-dyplomowa)

## Why not use already given template?

It's to big for my needs. I've removed some unnecessary packages and added some useful ones.

Also i think my template is more readable and easier to use (There is no need to use some old LaTeX compiler :P ).

## It's complete?

Of course it's not complete, i will expand it in the future with useful for me functionalities or requests (issues) in github.
